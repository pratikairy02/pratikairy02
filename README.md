## 🎯 About Me

Hi! I'm Pratik, a passionate data scientist and software engineer. I'm currently pursuing my **Master’s in Data Science** at Kent State University and have a strong interest in **Health Informatics Management**. With experience in **Python**, **R**, and **SQL**, I love creating interactive data-driven applications and models that solve real-world problems.

### Outside of tech, here are some things I love:
- 🥋 **Martial Arts** – I've dabbled in practicing martial arts, which keeps me disciplined.
- 💃 **Dancing and Listening to Music** – I believe these are the best ways to unwind after a long coding session.
- 🏆 **Playing carrom-board** – especially during events or family gatherings.
